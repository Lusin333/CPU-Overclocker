## History

Long ago, back in 1984, Lusin had a very slow computer (an AMD Ryzen 5950x).  Creating the videos and animations that you see on Lusin's Youtube channel was near impossible with the slow CPU on Lusin's computer. 

Something had to be done to improve the situation.  Thankfully, Lusin used his awesome programming skills and soon created the CPU Overclocker!  The CPU Overclocker is powerful software created in the programming language of HolyC.  Lusin was now able to overclock his AMD Ryzen 9 3950x CPU, making it far more powerful.  Lusin was able to play games and create entertaining videos with no problems.

Of course, Lusin also made the CPU Overclocker available to the public for free!  You're welcome, and enjoy!  ;)
